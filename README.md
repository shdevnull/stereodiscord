# StereoDiscord

Tired of experiencing mono audio while streaming on Discord? Fed up with having to screen share your apps just to get good sound quality? ðŸ™„ Say hello to ðŸŽ§StereoDiscordðŸŽ§!

With this BetterDiscord plugin, you can now select a stereo input device and offer a wider audio experience to your audience.

Why isn't this a feature in Discord already? ðŸ¤”
It's a frustration for many users that Discord does not have an option to select a stereo input device. Stereo sound greatly enhances the audio quality, making it a much more immersive and enjoyable experience. We hope that Discord will eventually add this feature to their platform, but until then, StereoDiscord is here to fill the gap.

So why wait? Be the envy of all your friends. Get [StereoDiscord](https://github.com/shdevnull/StereoDiscord/releases/) now!
